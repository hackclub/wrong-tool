# Clippy cheering someone on, right after they've built: the moment a sync (StreakActivity) shows a streak day
# crossing its 20 minutes, a cheer is queued (NudgeCheerJob) and sent then, or first thing in the morning if it's
# late, or an hour on from anything else Clippy's just said (Nudge::MESSAGE_GAP). One per day at most, and never
# counted against the slot nudges' weekly cap: these are earned.
#
# The bandit picks how Clippy cheers (its "cheer" bucket), and learns from whether they come back and build
# 20 minutes the next day (Nudge#window), so it finds the cheer that gets people building again rather than the
# one that reads nicest.
