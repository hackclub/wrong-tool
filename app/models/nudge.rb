# One message Clippy sent someone on Slack, and whether they built afterwards. Every send is logged with the odds the

# Every 15 minutes (NudgeDeliveryJob), anyone whose local time just reached the slot for when they said they'd build
# gets at most one: a fixed one if anything applies (Nudge::Fixed), otherwise whatever the bandit picks
# (Nudge::Bandit). And whenever a sync shows someone's just built their 20 minutes for the day, Clippy cheers
# (Nudge::Cheer). Nothing goes within MESSAGE_GAP of anything else Clippy DMed them (User#slack_dmed_at: nudges,
# cheers, rewards, a project linking itself), so his messages never land together: a nudge's slot passes, a cheer
# waits. Hourly (NudgeScoringJob), each one whose window has closed is scored on whether they built, or for a setup
# nudge, whether they did the step it asked for.
# What it says is Nudge::Copy, the Slack message is Nudge::Message, and its links are NudgeLinksController.
