# Who's building, day by day, after Duolingo's growth model (as Stardance runs it): every builder, every day of
# wrong tool, in one state by when they last built, and how many moved from each state one day to each state the
# next. Built on a day means ACTIVE_SECONDS or more on Hackatime that day (their synced streak day, StreakActivity):
# five minutes, well short of a streak's twenty, since this asks who showed up, not who did their bit.
#
# Only finished days are modelled (today's still filling in), and the whole thing is small enough to work out from
# the streak days each time, so nothing's snapshotted. PublicStats caches it with the rest of the page.
